# hashtag_handler

This repository has been created for the efficient semantic analysis of hastags and twitter sentences.

A lot of parameters are being currently tested which will later be uploaded here very soon.

Procedure to handling hashtags along with text:

1. Run the hashtag remover python file.
 
2. It will process the tweet_only.csv file and create the separated files.

3. But, this file needs to be preprocessed.

4. So, the already preprocessed files have been provided as separated_text_train.csv and separated_text_test.csv

5. Run the POS_hashtag_handler to gain knowledge of the parts of speech of the test data.

6. RUn the POS_stopwords_removal.py file to get the chunked and chinked file.

7. This file has all stopwords removed

8. More to come.
